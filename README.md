<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## InventaryX

This project aims to develop a basic product management application using the PERN stack, which includes PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. The application implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for products, allowing users to efficiently manage their inventory. Through an intuitive interface, users can add new products, view the list of existing products, modify product details, and delete those that are no longer needed. This application will serve as a solid foundation for understanding the integration of front-end and back-end technologies, as well as for applying best practices in the development of full-stack web applications.
